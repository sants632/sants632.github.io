        <p class="p1">
            Now here is something really interesting <span class="two">(to me)</span>,
            something you can use at a standing-up-only party 
            when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million 
            three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five <span class="two">words</span> used by 
            the Esimo for <span class="two">snow</span>. This is what Ezra Pound learned 
            from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so 
            constructed— <span class="two">English among them</span>—that we each only 
            really speak <span class="two">one sentence</span> in our lifetime. That 
            sentence begins with your <span class="two">first words</span>, toddling 
            around the kitchen, and ends with your <span class="two">last words</span> 
            right before you step into the limousine, or in a 
            nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on 
            hand. Or, if you are <span class="two">blessed</span>, they are heard by someone 
            who knows you and <span class="two">loves you</span> and will be sorry to hear 
            the sentence end. 
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            When I told Mr. Angel about the <span class="two">lifelong sentence</span>, 
            he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely 
            right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and 
            resemble the novel of a savant, but the <span class="two">next time</span> you
            use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used 
            mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be 
            <span class="two">thankful</span> that there exists this <span class="two">little thing</span>, 
            invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of 
            fact—that allows us to go on and keep on <span class="two">connecting</span> 
            speech that for all apparent purposes is <span class="two">unrelated</span>. 
        </p>

        <p class="p3">
            You might say a poem is a semicolon, a <span class="two">living</span> semicolon, 
            what connects the <span class="two">first line</span> to the <span class="two">last</span>, the act of 
            keeping together that whose <span class="two">nature</span> is to fly apart. 
            Between the first and last lines there exists—<span class="two">a 
            poem</span>—and if it were not for the poem that <span class="two">intervenes</span>, 
            the first and last lines of a poem would not <span class="two">speak to 
            each other</span>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a 
            poem are speaking to each other, <span class="two">not you to them or they
            to you</span>.
        </p>
