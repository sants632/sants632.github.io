        <p>
            I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of 
            opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, 
            across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that 
            first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and 
            that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, 
            because the words belong to completely different poems. 
            And I began to realize, reading these first and last 
            lines, that there are not only the first and last lines 
            of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first 
            and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to 
            use by others, by those we listen to.

            And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and 
            that end are the same: in poem after poem I encountered 
            words that mark the first something made out of language 
            that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a 
            refrain:

            <p>
                And I encountered words that mark the last something 
                made out of language that we hope to hear on earth:
