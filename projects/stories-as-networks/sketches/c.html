    <p class="word">
        In the beginning was the Word.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of <br> <span class="before"> thinkers
        who believe that in the beginning was the Act. That nothing can</span> <br> <span class="middle"> precede action— no breath before act, no thought before act, no 
        pervasive love before some kind of act.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
        <span class="middle">I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is 
        easier to talk about the end of a</span> <br> poem than it is to talk 
        about its beginning. Because the poem <br> <span class="before"> ends on the page, but 
            it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, 
         </span> <br> <span class="middle"> the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow 
        this happens, somehow</span> <br> a poem gets written in the
        middle of a chaotic holiday party <br> <span class="middle">that has just run out of ice, and it's 
        your house. </span>
    </p>

    <p class="p3">
        <span class="before">An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. 
        Be an act of Congress. <br> A state of real existence rather than 
        possibility. And poets love possibility! <br> <span class="middle"> They love to wonder 
        and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter</span> <br> <span class="before"> how full of 
            possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. 
        How a poem acts marks</span> <br> <span class="middle"> its individual character. A poem by 
        Glandolyn Blue does not sound</span> <br> like a poem by Timothy Sure. 
        To pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too,<br> <span class="before"> yes and always, 
        because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has 
        been from its <br> <span class="middle"> beginning; the human mind is capable of a great 
        elastic theater.</span> <br> As the poet Ralph Angel puts it, “The poem 
        is an interpretation <br> <span class="middle"> of weird theatrical shit.” The weird 
        theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day </span> <br> of our 
        lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his <br> <span class="before"> actions drama, 
        but no theater; theater requires that you draw 
        a circle around the action</span> <br> <span class="middle">and observe it from outside the 
        circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theater. </span>
    </p>

    <p class="p4">
        <span class="middle">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems 
        begin, </span> <br> the answer always the same: a phrase, a line, a 
        scrap of language, a rhythm, <br> <span class="before"> an image, something seen, heard, 
        witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is</span> <br> always the same, and 
        young poets recognize to be one of the most important 
        <br> <span class="middle">lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an 
        exact </span> <br> <span class="before">grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end 
        alley, at the top a cliff <br> <span class="middle">you haven’t even climbed. This 
        is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="p5">
        I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell 
        too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the 
        wrong idea.
