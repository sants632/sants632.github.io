        <p class="last-words">
            Among Emily Dickinson’s last words <br> (in a letter). 
            A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, 
            cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the 
            earth, her whole life, and it was finally time to go in. 
            <br> <em>And it was.</em>
