            I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and 
            at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and 
            say: <em>The End</em>. I miss finishing a novel and there on the 
            last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of 
            the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling <em>The End</em>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, 
            even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both 
            the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, 
            and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished 
            the book.

            I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the 
            words <em>The End</em>. Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the 
            brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that 
            there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon 
            worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then 
            I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand 
            in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India 
            ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the 
            words <em>The End</em>. And I realized children very often denote the 
            end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have 
            written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number 
            of stories and poems that have already been written; they know 
            some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which 
            they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so 
            they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a 
            wonderful thing.

            Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece 
            of writing: the ending will have the last word or the ending will 
            be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something 
            unexpectedly incongruent.

            Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing 
            thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our 
            disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of 
            something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and 
            the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment 
            and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our 
            knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, 
            by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, 
            think about it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try 
            inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding 
            that in the beginning was the act, not the word.

            The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of 
            paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness 
            which ideas can never claim.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses 
            text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, 
            usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and 
            lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.

        <p>
            Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have 
            consequences (endings).
        </p>

        <p>
            The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit 
            and I will take from it a seed and plant it and watch grow the 
            tree from which it fell.
        </p>

        <p>
            Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of 
            How Poems End, says this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this 
            may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension 
            seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most 
            gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created 
            are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an 
            experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations 
            that are aroused are also fulfilled.”
        </p>

        <p>
            But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. 
            How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that 
            precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of 
            the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning,
            before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to 
            the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and
            we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
